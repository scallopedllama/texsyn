<h1>Algorithm details</h1>

<P>
Let <TT>SampleImage</TT> contain the image we are sampling from and
let <TT>Image</TT> be the mostly empty image that we want to fill in (if
synthesizing from scratch, it should contain a 3-by-3 seed in the
center randomly taken from <TT>SampleImage</TT>, for constrained synthesis
it should contain all the known pixels).  <TT>WindowSize</TT>, the size
of the neighborhood window, is the only user-settable parameter.  The
main portion of the algorithm is presented below:
<PRE>
function GrowImage(SampleImage,Image,WindowSize)
  while Image not filled do
    progress = 0
    PixelList = GetUnfilledNeighbors(Image)
    foreach Pixel in PixelList do
      Template = GetNeighborhoodWindow(Pixel)
      BestMatches = FindMatches(Template, SampleImage)
      BestMatch = RandomPick(BestMatches)
      if (BestMatch.error &lt; MaxErrThreshold) then
        Pixel.value = BestMatch.value
        progress = 1
      end
    end
    if progress == 0 
      then MaxErrThreshold = MaxErrThreshold * 1.1
  end
  return Image
end
</PRE>
Function <TT>GetUnfilledNeighbors()</TT> returns a list of all unfilled
pixels that have filled pixels as their neighbors (the image is
subtracted from its morphological dilation).  The list is randomly
permuted and then sorted by decreasing number of filled neighbor
pixels.  <TT>GetNeigborhoodWindow()</TT> returns a window of size <TT>WindowSize</TT> around a given pixel.  <TT>RandomPick()</TT> picks an element
randomly from the list.  <TT>FindMatches()</TT> is as follows:
<PRE>
function FindMatches(Template,SampleImage)
  ValidMask = 1s where Template is filled, 0s otherwise
  GaussMask = Gaussian2D(WindowSize,Sigma)
  TotWeight = sum i,j GaussiMask(i,j)*ValidMask(i,j)
  for i,j do
    for ii,jj do
      dist = (Template(ii,jj)-SampleImage(i-ii,j-jj))^2
      SSD(i,j) = SSD(i,j) + dist*ValidMask(ii,jj)*GaussMask(ii,jj)
    end
    SSD(i,j) = SSD(i,j) / TotWeight
  end
  PixelList = all pixels (i,j) where SSD(i,j) &lt;= min(SSD)*(1+ErrThreshold)
  return PixelList
end
</PRE>
<TT>Gaussian2D()</TT> generates a two-dimensional Gaussian in a window of
given a size centered in the center and with a given standard
deviation (in pixels).  In our implementation the constant were set as
follows: <TT>ErrThreshold = 0.1</TT>, <TT>MaxErrThreshold = 0.3</TT>, 
<TT>Sigma = WindowSize/6.4</TT>.  Pixel values are in the range of 0 to 1.
